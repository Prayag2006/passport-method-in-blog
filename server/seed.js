By executing code exclusively on the server, we can significantly reduce the JavaScript bundle size shipped to the client, while seamlessly querying databases and accessing server-side APIs. This paradigm shift introduces a new mental model for state management and data fetching, leading to highly performant and SEO-friendly applications without the complexity of traditional SSR setups.',
